# üõ°Ô∏è PhishHook ‚Äì AI-Powered Cybersecurity System for Banks

*IDEA Hackathon*

## Overview
Phishing remains one of the most pervasive and devastating threats to modern banking systems. With attackers constantly refining their tactics, traditional defenses struggle to keep up. Financial institutions face increasingly sophisticated attacks involving behavioral mimicry, deceptive interfaces, and evolving social engineering methods. These phishing techniques bypass static filters, exploit human error, and compromise sensitive operations.

**PhishHook** was built to meet a real and growing need in today‚Äôs banking world‚Äîstaying ahead of cybercriminals. Instead of relying on outdated lists or rigid detection rules, PhishHook takes a more intelligent, adaptive approach to cybersecurity, one that understands how real users behave and how attackers try to imitate them.

- **DNA Fingerprinting**
- **Phantom Cyber-Space Overlay**
- **Superfluid Phishing Detection**

PhishHook doesn‚Äôt get in the way of regular users. It‚Äôs built to be lightweight, targeting only critical actions so it doesn‚Äôt slow things down. It also works easily with systems banks already have in place‚Äîno massive overhauls needed.

## üß¨ Digital DNA Fingerprinting 

**PhishHook** introduces a next-generation security framework that merges **AI-enhanced digital fingerprinting** with **real-time SSL certificate validation**, providing precise, adaptive, and robust protection for banking systems.

### What is Digital DNA Fingerprinting?

This technology captures a unique behavioral and structural signature or a ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù of every legitimate website by analyzing:

- Domain structure  
- Source code (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- Visual assets (logos, fonts, layouts)  
- SSL certificate data  

These components are hashed into a secure profile and stored in a trusted, encrypted database. Even subtle changes in any of these traits trigger alerts, making spoofing and impersonation virtually impossible.

### Why Integrate SSL Certificate Validation?

SSL certificates are the digital trust badges of the internet but they‚Äôre not foolproof. PhishHook actively verifies:

- Certificate authenticity and expiry  
- Chain of trust and issuing authority  
- Revocation status via transparency logs  

Invalid, expired, or mismatched certificates immediately signal possible phishing attempts‚Äîeven if the rest of the site appears legitimate.

### How It Works Together

1. **Fingerprint Generation**: AI builds a comprehensive identity profile of each approved site.  
2. **SSL Cross-Check**: Every user visit triggers a live SSL check against transparency logs.  
3. **Threat Detection**: AI compares real-time activity with known patterns and raises instant flags on mismatches.  
4. **Continuous Learning**: PhishHook adapts with every interaction, making detection sharper over time.

### Key Benefits

- Early detection of fake, misconfigured, or expired certificates  
- Protection from SSL stripping and downgrade attacks  
- Enhanced fraud detection
- Real-time alerts to users before harm is done  

PhishHook‚Äôs fingerprinting and certificate validation system doesn‚Äôt just stop phishing‚Äîit evolves faster than attackers can adapt. By placing behavior, structure, and trust under constant AI surveillance, we secure the web at its weakest points‚Äîbefore the first click goes wrong.

## üëª Phantom Cyber-Space Overlay 

The Phantom Cyber-Space Overlay introduces an advanced and invisible layer of phishing protection that continuously shields users from attacks without disrupting their browsing experience. As users interact with a website, it works silently in the background, actively monitoring suspicious activities commonly associated with phishing attempts.

- Suspicious URL Redirections: Identifies and flags unusual redirects leading to fraudulent sites such as fake login pages or malware-laden websites designed to steal credentials.  
- Anomalies in URL Structures: Phishing often involves manipulating domain names through typosquatting and homograph attacks. These tactic can be difficult for users to spot, but Phantom Overlay is designed to identify and thwart such deceptive activities in real-time.  
- Fake Forms or Hidden Scripts: Flags malicious forms crafted to capture sensitive personal information and hidden scripts that may compromise user data or devices.

- **String Matching for Typosquatting Detection:**  
Typosquatting involves attackers creating domain names similar to legitimate ones but containing slight, deliberate typos. Phantom Overlay combats this using sophisticated Levenshtein distance algorithms, which measure similarity between strings. This allows identification of slight differences in domain names users might overlook. Users are alerted to these subtle discrepancies in real time, enhancing protection.

- **Homograph Attack Detection Using Punycode:**  
Homograph attacks use characters from different alphabets that look nearly identical to Latin letters, tricking users into believing they are visiting trusted sites. These attacks are difficult to detect because altered domain names look almost identical to legitimate ones.  
The Phantom Overlay uses Punycode encoding, converting non-ASCII characters (e.g., Cyrillic or Greek letters) into ASCII-compatible format, enabling detection and flagging of homograph attacks. Upon detection, the system immediately alerts users, preventing access to fraudulent sites.

- **Detecting Fake CAPTCHA:**  
Phishing sites may replicate legitimate CAPTCHA systems to deceive users. String matching can help flag suspicious domain names related to CAPTCHA implementations. Behavioral analysis of user interactions with CAPTCHA (mouse movements, typing speed) can also reveal anomalies, distinguishing fake CAPTCHAs from real ones.

### Key Benefits

- Zero Disruption to User Experience  
- Real-Time Alerts  
- Enhanced Detection of Subtle Phishing Attacks  

# üåä Superfluid Phishing Detection

The concept of Superfluid Detection operates under the principle inspired by the physics of a superfluid- a fluid that has zero viscosity and therefore flows without any loss of kinetic energy. Similarly, digital interactions like mouse clicks, form submissions, and data exchanges normally flow in predictable, organized patterns without resistance or disruption, much like a superfluid. This ‚Äúunattacked‚Äù data flow behaves smoothly and continuously. However, the moment an attack occurs, this flow is disrupted, introducing irregularities and friction-like effects that break the superfluid behavior. Such disruptions, caused by hidden or deceptive actions on a website, trigger a flag indicating a potential anomaly. The goal is to actively monitor the system, offering the ability to detect suspicious elements in real-time rather than waiting for post-event analysis.  

---

## How Superfluid Detection Works

### 1. Tracking User Interactions
As users navigate a website, every click, input, and page transition creates a "flow" of data. Superfluid detection tracks this flow and watches for any unusual disruptions or deviations. For example, if a user fills out a form, the system expects certain behavior, such as the form submission being linked to a legitimate action. However, if there are hidden actions‚Äîsuch as the form‚Äôs data being redirected to an unknown or unexpected destination‚Äîthe system recognizes this as an irregularity in the flow.

**Example:**  
If a form is embedded in a website but not visible to the user (a "hidden" form), Superfluid detection would track the user's input to the form. If/when the form starts transmitting sensitive data, the system can flag this action as potentially suspicious, blocking the submission before it reaches a malicious destination.

### 2. Deceptive Scripts & Hidden Interactions
A major concern is the presence of deceptive scripts or background actions that manipulate the flow of interaction. These could be scripts designed to intercept form inputs, reroute data, or alter how a user perceives an interaction. Superfluid detection tracks the timing, sequence, and data transfer rate, which could reveal that something isn‚Äôt quite right‚Äîsuch as if data is being sent in the background without the user‚Äôs explicit consent or knowledge.

**Example:**  
If a script alters the flow of form submission, say by redirecting data to an external server, the Superfluid detection system would recognize the unexpected transfer pattern and flag it as an irregularity.

## Incorporating URL Shorteners and Link Expiration Detection

Phishing campaigns often rely on tactics that obscure the true nature of a URL‚Äîone such tactic is URL shorteners. These tools allow malicious actors to mask the actual destination of a link, often making it difficult for users to recognize whether the destination is legitimate or not. Additionally, link expiration is another tactic employed by attackers, where links are only active for a brief period to avoid detection by security systems.

Superfluid detection integrates these techniques by monitoring shortened URLs and tracking their expiration status. By doing so, the system can analyze the final destination of a shortened URL and track its lifecycle to ensure the link remains active and consistent throughout the user interaction.

### URL Shortener Detection

#### 1. Real-Time Expansion & Analysis
URL shorteners obfuscate the true destination by transforming a long, convoluted URL into something more manageable and appealing for users to click. However, these shortened links can often hide the true intent behind them. The Superfluid system can expand shortened URLs in real time to reveal the full URL and analyze the content of this URL for any suspicious keywords (e.g., "login," "verify," "reset"). It can check for these keywords because they often appear in phishing or malicious links.

**Example:**  
When a user encounters a shortened URL, the system automatically expands it and analyzes the full link. If the URL contains terms like "reset" or "login," the system may flag it as suspicious, providing a warning to the user.

#### 2. URL Analysis Beyond Shortening
Not only does the system expand the URL to check specific keywords, but it also checks the reputation of the destination URL. If the URL points to a suspicious or previously flagged domain, the system can immediately alert the user about the risks associated with visiting that destination.

**Example:**  
A user clicks on a shortened URL, and the system uncovers that the destination is a domain with a history of malicious activity. The system would then present a warning or block the link altogether, preventing the user from accessing potentially harmful content.

---

### Link Expiration Detection

#### 1. Tracking Link Lifespan
Many attackers use short-lived URLs‚Äîlinks that are only active for a brief time‚Äîbecause they often aim to avoid detection or stop security systems from recognizing malicious links in time. These links may expire after a few minutes or hours, making it more challenging to flag them as dangerous during the typical scan or detection process.

Superfluid detection can track the expiration time of URLs and identify if a link has a short lifespan (e.g., set to expire in a few minutes). The system recognizes that links that disappear too quickly may be designed to evade detection.

**Example:**  
If a URL is set to expire in less than an hour, Superfluid detection can flag the link and prevent the user from accessing it before the link expires. This feature helps prevent situations where the link is overlooked by other security measures due to its transient nature.

#### 2. Timing Alerts for Users
Links set to expire quickly may be flagged in real-time, with a warning given to the user about the potential risks. The system helps users become aware of the time-sensitive nature of the link, ensuring that they are not misled into clicking a link that may vanish before the malicious nature can be detected.

## The Combined Benefits of Superfluid Detection with URL Shorteners & Link Expiration Monitoring

1. **Enhanced Real-Time Monitoring of User Data Flow:**  
By continuously tracking the flow of data through a website, the Superfluid detection system can identify suspicious behavior patterns that deviate from expected interaction flows. Hidden forms, deceptive scripts, and unauthorized data manipulation can all be flagged immediately, giving users an added layer of protection.

2. **Automatic URL Expansion & Contextual Analysis:**  
Shortened URLs are expanded automatically and analyzed to ensure users are not directed to malicious sites. This real-time expansion adds a vital layer of protection.

3. **Detection of Time-Sensitive Malicious Links:**  
Monitoring the expiration of URLs is a proactive defense against short-lived phishing or malicious links. By tracking the lifespan of links, the system ensures that users are not interacting with URLs that could vanish before they can be flagged or analyzed by traditional methods.

4. **Comprehensive Protection Against Deceptive Link Strategies:**  
URL shorteners and link expiration are common tools used by attackers to obscure malicious destinations. By integrating these monitoring tactics with Superfluid detection, websites and systems can proactively detect and block these deceptive strategies, providing users a safer online experience.

# Proposed Solution

Our AI-powered phishing detection system leverages multiple AWS and cloud security tools to create a scalable, efficient, and real-time protective framework. Below is an elaborated description of how we will use each technology in detail.

---

# Technologies Used and How We Will Use Them

### 1. AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)
 
  We will configure AWS WAF to serve as the first line of defense by setting up custom rules that:  
  - Block requests from IPs/domains flagged in threat intelligence feeds (using AWS Managed Rules and custom IP sets).  
  - Enforce SSL validation by integrating AWS WAF with AWS Certificate Manager, rejecting requests with invalid or missing certificates.  
  - Use regex matching to detect suspicious URL patterns, including URLs with Punycode or IDN characters.  
  - Monitor only sensitive endpoints (e.g., `/login`, `/payment`) to reduce overhead and false alarms.  
  AWS WAF will also be configured to log all traffic metadata and blocked request details into CloudWatch Logs for audit and further analysis.

---

### 2. Secure Web Gateway (Zscaler / Cisco Umbrella)

  We will deploy Secure Web Gateway solutions as part of the network infrastructure for DNS filtering and traffic monitoring:  
  - DNS requests from client machines will be routed through Cisco Umbrella or Zscaler.  
  - These services will block resolution of known malicious domains and redirect suspicious requests to a quarantine or warning page.  
  - Integrate logs from these services into our central monitoring dashboard using APIs to correlate with AWS WAF data for comprehensive threat visibility.  

---

### 3. AWS Lambda (Python) + AI Model for UI Analysis

  - Upon detection of sensitive actions (login, payment) by AWS WAF, a trigger will invoke a Lambda function.  
  - Lambda will programmatically scrape the webpage‚Äôs HTML, CSS, and JS assets either via a headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer/Playwright) or by using APIs exposed by the front-end.  
  - The scraped content will be passed to a pre-trained AI model (deployed within Lambda or accessed via an API endpoint) that analyzes the UI components for anomalies such as:  
    - Fake captchas that don‚Äôt function correctly or are visually inconsistent.  
    - Hidden form fields or scripts designed to steal credentials.  
    - Suspicious pop-ups or modal dialogs not consistent with legitimate UX patterns.  
  - Lambda will assign an anomaly score to each interaction and send flagged results downstream for processing.

```python
import boto3
import requests

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Extract shortened URL from the event (e.g., from API Gateway)
    short_url = event.get('short_url')
    
    # Expand shortened URL using a HEAD request to follow redirects
    try:
        response = requests.head(short_url, allow_redirects=True, timeout=5)
        expanded_url = response.url
    except Exception as e:
        return {'statusCode': 500, 'body': f"Error expanding URL: {str(e)}"}
    
    # Simple keyword check for suspicious terms
    suspicious_keywords = ['login', 'verify', 'reset', 'account', 'secure']
    if any(keyword in expanded_url.lower() for keyword in suspicious_keywords):
        alert = True
    else:
        alert = False
    
    # Optionally check domain reputation here (stubbed)
    domain_reputation = check_domain_reputation(expanded_url)
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': {
            'expanded_url': expanded_url,
            'suspicious': alert,
            'domain_reputation': domain_reputation
        }
    }

def check_domain_reputation(url):
    # Placeholder: integrate with domain reputation APIs (e.g., VirusTotal, Google Safe Browsing)
    # For demo, return "clean"
    return "clean"
```

### 4. DynamoDB, SQS, and Kinesis Firehose

  - **SQS:** Lambda functions will asynchronously push flagged events into an SQS queue to decouple detection from further processing and to handle spikes in flagged activity smoothly.  
  - **DynamoDB:** A backend service will poll the SQS queue and write detailed event data into DynamoDB tables designed with a schema optimized for fast querying and trend analysis. Event data includes: URLs, timestamps, anomaly scores, IP addresses, and user-agent info.  
  - **Kinesis Firehose:** We will stream processed event data from DynamoDB or directly from the Lambda output into Amazon Kinesis Firehose for real-time analytics and visualization via tools such as Amazon QuickSight or custom dashboards. This allows security analysts to monitor threat trends in near real time.  

---

### 5. CloudWatch, EventBridge, and SNS for Monitoring and Alerts

  - **CloudWatch:** We will aggregate logs and metrics from AWS WAF, Lambda invocations, DynamoDB operations, and SQS queue depth. Custom CloudWatch alarms will monitor anomalies such as spikes in flagged events or Lambda errors.  
  - **EventBridge:** We will configure EventBridge rules that listen for high-severity flagged events (e.g., anomaly score above a threshold) from the threat processing pipeline.  
  - **SNS:** Once EventBridge triggers an alert, SNS will push notifications instantly to security teams via email, SMS, or integration with communication platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams.  
  - Additionally, EventBridge will automate AWS WAF updates by programmatically adding IPs/domains or blocking suspicious URLs identified by the AI model, effectively creating a feedback loop to block new threats automatically.  

---

### 6. Punycode Conversion & IDN Normalization
 
  - Before any URL is processed by our detection system, it will be normalized:  
    - Convert any Unicode characters to their ASCII-compatible Punycode representations using libraries like `idna` in Python.  
    - Normalize internationalized domain names to their canonical form to prevent homograph attacks.  
  - Our AI model and URL filters will then analyze these normalized URLs to detect spoofing attempts that use visually similar characters to impersonate legitimate domains.  

---

# Implementation Workflow Overview

1. **Traffic Filtering:** Incoming requests pass through AWS WAF and Secure Web Gateway. Suspicious URLs or IPs are blocked upfront; requests to sensitive endpoints trigger further analysis.  
2. **Trigger AI Analysis:** Lambda is triggered on sensitive actions, scraping UI data and running anomaly detection models.  
3. **Queue & Store:** Flagged events are placed in SQS, processed and stored in DynamoDB for persistence and historical analytics.  
4. **Real-Time Analytics:** Kinesis Firehose streams data to dashboards; CloudWatch monitors system health.  
5. **Alerting & Automated Blocking:** EventBridge listens for high-risk events, triggering SNS alerts and auto-updating WAF rules.  
6. **Continuous Feedback:** Data collected is used to retrain AI models periodically and refine detection rules to reduce false positives.
